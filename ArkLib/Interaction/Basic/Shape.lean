# Functorial local syntax over interaction trees

This file introduces the functorial refinement of the local syntax core.

`Spec.SyntaxOver` in `Basic/Syntax` is the most general local syntax object: it
describes which node object an agent has at one protocol node, with no
assumption that recursive continuations can be reindexed generically.

`Spec.ShapeOver` is the functorial refinement of that base notion:
it equips a `SyntaxOver` with a continuation map. This is exactly the extra
structure needed to define generic output transport such as
`ShapeOver.mapOutput`.

Many important interaction objects are syntax without being shapes in this
sense: if recursive continuations are hidden under an opaque outer constructor,
then a generic continuation map may not exist. This is why `SyntaxOver` is the
semantic base layer, while `ShapeOver` is the stronger interface used when
continuations are exposed functorially enough.

Naming note:
`ShapeOver` keeps the suffix form because it is the primary *functorial*
refinement of syntax, with plain `Shape` recovered as the trivial-context
specialization. This differs from `Decoration.Over`, which is literally
dependent data over a fixed base decoration value.

`ShapeOver Agent Γ` is a functorial local-syntax object over realized node
contexts `Γ`.

It answers the following question:

> Suppose we are standing at one protocol node whose move space is `X`.
> The node carries realized node-local context `γ : Γ X`.
> If the protocol continues with family `Cont : X → Type w`, what is the type
> of the local object that agent `a` stores at this node?

Unlike bare `SyntaxOver`, a `ShapeOver` also provides a generic continuation
map. So a shape is syntax that is *functorial in its recursive continuations*.

This is the right abstraction when node objects support a generic reindexing of
their continuation payload, for example when those continuations remain exposed
or are stored under constructors with a functorial action.

  `map` expresses that a node object is functorial in its continuation family.

If we know how to transform each continuation value `A x` into a
continuation value `B x`, then we can transform a local node object with
  continuation family `A` into one with continuation family `B`.

  Importantly, `map` does **not** change:
  * the agent,
  * the move space,
  * the node-local context,
  * or the move `x` that will eventually be chosen.

  It only reinterprets what happens *after* each possible move.
  This is the local ingredient needed to define the generic whole-tree
  `ShapeOver.mapOutput` below.

`Shape Agent` is the specialization of `ShapeOver` with no node-local context.

This is the right facade when the protocol tree carries no node metadata at all.
Equivalently, it is `ShapeOver Agent Spec.Node.Context.empty`.

Reindex a local syntax object contravariantly along a node-context morphism.

If `f : Γ → Δ`, then any shape over `Δ` can be viewed as a shape over `Γ` by
first viewing its underlying syntax through `SyntaxOver.comap f`.

`ShapeOver.mapOutput` lifts a pointwise transformation of leaf outputs to a
transformation of whole-tree participant objects.

This is the recursive global form of the local `ShapeOver.map` field.
It leaves the underlying interactive structure unchanged and only rewrites the
terminal output family.
